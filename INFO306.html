<h1><B>
    Travelling in Depression
</B></h1>
<body>
    <P>
        When I was very little, I caught the travel bug.It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in
        France and I have now been to twenty-nine different countries.<BR>Each has given me a unique learning experience.<br>
     <br>At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights.<br>When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco
     megalithic structure of Stonehenge and walked along the GreatWall of China, amazed that the thousand-year-oldstones were still in place.<br>
     <br>It was through exploring cultures around the world that I first became interested in language.<br>

     It began with French, which taught me the importance of pronunciation.<br><br>
     I remember once asking a store owner in Paris where Rue des Pyramides was.<br><br><br>
     But when I pronounced it PYR–a–mides instead of pyr–A–mides, with more accent on the A, she looked at me bewildered.<br>
     <br>In the eighth grade, I became fascinated with Spanish and aware of its similarities with English through cognates. Baseball in Spanish, for example, is
     béisbol, which looks different but sounds nearly the same.<br><br>
     This was incredible to me as it made speech and
     comprehension more fluid, and even today I find that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in Spanish.<br><br>
     Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese.
     As I studied Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a character, the meaning is lost.<br>
     I loved how long words were formed by combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning 
     mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means volcano.<br>
    <br> I love spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.<br>
